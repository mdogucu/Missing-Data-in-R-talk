# Handling Missing Data in R

Invited Talk by Mine Dogucu and Sunwoo Ha at St. Thomas University on March 16, 2018.

The code mentioned in the [presentation](https://github.com/mdogucu/Missing-Data-in-R-talk/blob/master/Handling%20Missing%20Data%20in%20R.pdf) can be found as an [R file](https://github.com/mdogucu/Missing-Data-in-R-talk/blob/master/missing%20data%20demonstration.R). The code uses a simulated [complete data](https://github.com/mdogucu/Missing-Data-in-R-talk/blob/master/complete.csv) and [incomplete data](https://github.com/mdogucu/Missing-Data-in-R-talk/blob/master/missing.csv). The missingness is introduced by MAR mechanism.
